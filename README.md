# MediKiosk

> An intelligent, bilingual patient intake kiosk and physician dashboard designed for high-volume outpatient hospital departments (OPDs). Built for the Ministry of Ayush and the All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA).

---

## 📌 Overview

MediKiosk streamlines hospital OPD queues by capturing detailed patient clinical histories and digitizing past medical records before the patient enters the consultation room.

Patients interact with the kiosk using voice or touch in **Hindi, Telugu, or English**. The system asks relevant clinical questions, scans uploaded prescriptions or lab reports, and synthesizes everything into a structured summary for the attending doctor.
